Intro to Clojure-clr - Clojure for .NET Developers
====================================================

Code and Slides for my Intro to Clojure-clr talk at the 2012 Richmond CodeCamp 

Learn how to install Clojure-clr, use .NET libraries, connect to a database and Create UIs using Clojure. I will begin with an introduction to Clojure syntax followed by an example of how to make calls into a .NET library. Next, we will make queries into a database and display the results in a Windows.Forms UI.

## Setup 
- Install Clojure-Clr [Get the Binaries](https://github.com/clojure/clojure-clr/wiki/Getting-binaries)
- Add the directory you unzip the binaries into in your PATH
- Add the environment variable CLOJURE_LOAD_PATH and set it to the Clojure-clr directory
